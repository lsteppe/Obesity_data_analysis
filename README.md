# Obesity_Income_Physical_Activity_data_analysis

## Overview
Comparing Income level against Physical Activity using US Census Data.

### Dataset Source
This dataset was obtained from the [data.gov website](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nutrition-physical-activity-and-obesity-behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system) and includes census data on Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity - Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

### Dataset Description
This dataset encompasses data on adult's diet, physical activity, and weight status from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. It is utilized for DNPAO's Data, Trends, and Maps database, which offers national and state-specific data on obesity, nutrition, physical activity, and breastfeeding.

### Analysis Objective
The code will process the data by performing the following tasks:
- Reading and cleaning the data.
- Filtering the dataset to display only data related to income and physical activity.
- Creating separate bar plots for each unique question in the dataset.

### Data File
To use the code, you need to download the original CSV data file. You can download it from [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nutrition-physical-activity-and-obesity-behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system).

**Note:** After downloading, save the file to your local drive. Remember to modify the `file_path` in the code (line 16) to the location where you've saved the file on your machine.
